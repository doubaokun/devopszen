About DevOps Zen

```
Automated is better than manual.
 
Reusable is better than repeatable.
 
Multiple is better than single.
 
Single is better than unstable.
 
Continuous is better than planned.
 
Now is better than never.
 
Although never is often better than *right* now.
 
Special cases aren't special enough to be manual.
 
Collaboration rules over the rules.
 
In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.
 
There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to automate.
 
If the automation is complex, it's a bad idea.
 
If the automation is simple, it may be a good idea.
 
Infrastructure as code is one honking great idea -- let's do more!
